# Telco Customer Churn â€” End-to-End
ðŸ“Œ Overview

- The Customer Churn Prediction Project is a complete end-to-end machine learning solution designed to predict whether a telecom customer will churn (leave the service) or stay subscribed.
- It covers every stage of the ML lifecycle â€” from data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to deployment using FastAPI and Docker â€” making it production-ready and easy to extend.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Telecommunication companies often struggle to retain customers.
This project aims to:
- Predict the likelihood of customer churn.
- Identify key factors driving churn.
- Help businesses take data-driven retention actions.

Key Features

âœ… Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Pandas
âœ… Model Training using Random Forest Classifier
âœ… Model Evaluation using AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
âœ… API Deployment using FastAPI + Uvicorn
âœ… Containerization using Docker
âœ… Ready for integration with web apps or dashboards
```

## Quick start (manual dataset)
1. Download `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` 
2. Place the CSV at `data/raw/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`.
3. Create a Python venv and install requirements:
``` bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Notes & Next steps 
Place the CSV in data/raw/ before running src/train.py.

The src/features.py preprocessor expects the full set of raw CSV columns; the Streamlit example sends a minimal set and uses defaults â€” for production, create a contract and validate fields.

For production readiness: wrap preprocessing and model into a single sklearn Pipeline (already done in src/train.py) and add input validation.

If you want, I can now:

## Business Recommendations
Based on model insights:

Offer Loyalty Programs to customers with short tenure (< 6 months).

Reduce Monthly Charges or introduce bundled offers for high-charge users.

Improve Support for users lacking TechSupport or OnlineSecurity.

Target Fiber-Optic Customers who show higher churn risk.

Encourage Long-Term Contracts, as two-year customers churn less.
